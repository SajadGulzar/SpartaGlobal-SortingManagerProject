# Sparta Global SortManager Project
### What is the project about?

This project is a sort manager that can take user input to generate an array of random numbers or user specified numbers and sort those numbers.
It includes a bubble sorter, merge sorter, and a binary tree that has a binary tree sorter.

The program outputs the unsorted array, the sort algorithm used, the sorted array, and the time taken to sort the array.

### What are the different tools used?

- Maven is used for build automatic and dependency management (such as for the tools listed below).
- JUnit is used for unit testing of the project.
- Log4j is used for logging.

### What are the different functionalities?

There is the implementation for a binary tree including getting a sorted tree. There is also merge and bubble sorting algorithms.

There is a random number generator that can generate a specified amount of numbers within a range.

### Using the Sort Manager:

To use the Sort Manager program, clone a copy to your machine locally. Run the 'RunApp' file to run the program. 

You will be met with a question asking how many random numbers you would like to sort and fill your array with. 

#### Sorting Algorithm

After you have selected the numbers you will be then be asked what sorting algorithm you want to use.

- 1 for Bubble Sort
- 2 for Binary Sort
- 3 for Merge Sort

### Results

Following your selections, you will be provided with:

    1) The name of the sort
    2) A copy of the array before being sorted
    3) A copy of the array after it has been sorted 
    4) The total time it took to sort the array in nanoseconds (with additional breakdowns in milliseconds and seconds)
